    <p>Dean Winchester <br><br>
        He is the oldest son of John and Mary, the older brother of Sam. He is one of the members of the Winchester
        family. When he was young he was forced to grow up right away in order to take care of his little brother, Sam,
        who eventually became who he was in life. He was raised into hunting by his father, John.  Dean eventually dies
        during a vampire hunt gone wrong and goes to Heaven. <br><br>

<div class="sam">
        Sam Winchester <br><br>
        He is the youngest son of John and Mary. He is the younger brother of Dean and the older paternal half-brother
        of Adam. He is one of the three surviving members of the Winchester family. His father, John, hadn't brought him
        into hunting right away like his older brother, Dean. Instead, he had to find out who his family was the hard
        way and eventually was forced to go into "The Family Business". He had always been the odd one out but
        eventually accepted the fact that hunting was who he is. Sam eventually has a family, grows to old age and dies
        of natural causes before being reunited with Dean in Heaven.</p>
