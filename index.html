        <p id="spnText"> Supernatural is an American television series created by Eric Kripke. It was first broadcast
            on September 13,
            2005, on The WB, and subsequently became part of successor network The CW's lineup. Starring Jared Padalecki
            as
            Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester, the series follows the two brothers as they hunt
            demons,
            ghosts, monsters and other supernatural beings.
            <br>
            Supernatural was in development for nearly ten years, as creator Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully
            pitching it. Along with Kripke, its executive producers included McG, Robert Singer, Phil Sgriccia, Sera
            Gamble,
            Jeremy Carver, John Shiban, Ben Edlund and Adam Glass. Former executive producer and director Kim Manners
            died
            during production of the fourth season. Filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and in
            surrounding areas. The series was produced by Kripke Enterprises and McG's Wonderland Sound and Vision, in
            association with Warner Bros. Television.
            <br>
            The pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, and the ratings of the first four episodes
            prompted
            The WB to pick up the series for a full season. Kripke planned the series for three seasons but later
            expanded
            it to five. The fifth season concluded the series' main storyline, and Kripke departed the series as
            showrunner.
            The series continued on for 10 more seasons with new showrunners, including Sera Gamble, Jeremy Carver,
            Robert
            Singer and Andrew Dabb. With its eleventh season, Supernatural became the longest-running American
            live-action
            fantasy TV series. The series was renewed for a fifteenth and final season that consisted of 20 episodes,
            and
            premiered on October 10, 2019. Supernatural concluded on November 19, 2020, with 327 episodes aired.
